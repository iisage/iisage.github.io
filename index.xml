      <description>NSF Project Summary Overview In many mammals, females tend to live longer than males. In addition, sex differences in lifespan and aging are well documented in non-mammalian species, in both wild and captive populations, and in model systems maintained under controlled laboratory conditions. However, sex differences in lifespan vary considerably across animal taxa, with some species exhibiting similar lifespans between the sexes and others showing increased lifespan in one sex. How sex differences in aging and longevity arise and how they are linked to molecular drivers of aging such as genome instability is currently unknown.</description>
