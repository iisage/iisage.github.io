<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>We have established a Biology Integration Institute to determine how genome architecture, organismal biology, and phenotypic plasticity contribute to sex-specific aging and its evolution. In many species across the animal kingdom, one sex ages faster or has a longer lifespan. This sex specific
aging has significant implications for conservation, agriculture, and human health. However, no unified model exists that reveals how mechanistic and evolutionary processes cause the diverse patterns of sex-specific aging seen in nature. Furthermore, current research on sex-specific aging has been siloed because researchers primarily use discipline-specific
approaches without integration.</p>
<p>The <strong>Integration Institute: Sex, Aging, Genomics, and Evolution (IISAGE)</strong> will bring together expertise from evolutionary biology, molecular genetics, genomics, physiology, and computational biology to identify the molecular mechanisms generating sex differences in aging. Working with amniotes, fish, and insects, IISAGE will define the rules that govern sex-specific aging. Tightly integrated projects with common methodologies will test hypotheses focused on differences between the sexes in genome architecture, organismal biology, and phenotypic plasticity to understand sex-specific aging. Through an integrated, iterative process of data
collection, modeling, and hypothesis testing, IISAGE will define how processes at the molecular, organismal, and population level interact to generate sex-specific aging and develop predictive models for how sex differences in aging arise. Scientific projects are organized into four themes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Theme 1:</em> Determine how sex determination systems, sex chromosomes, dosage
compensation, and heterochromatin content contribute to sex differences in aging.</li>
<li><em>Theme 2:</em> Investigate how cellular stress responses, sexual size dimorphism, and sex
reversal impact sex differences in aging.</li>
<li><em>Theme 3:</em> Define how phenotypic plasticity impacts sex-specific aging.</li>
<li><em>Theme 4:</em> Identify pathways that drive sex differences in aging by integrating data from themes 1-3 using multi-omics Machine Learning in a phylogenetic comparative framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will define commonalities and species-specific mechanisms of sex-specific aging.</p>
<h2 id="intellectual-merit">Intellectual Merit</h2>
<p>Sex differences in aging are common in many taxa but vary significantly, and the mechanisms that control them are not understood. Identifying rules that explain sex differences in aging is challenging because phenotypic sex is confounded with many other differences between males and females. IISAGE will determine how genome architecture, organismal biology, and phenotypic plasticity generate sex differences in aging and define evolutionarily conserved and taxon-specific mechanisms controlling sex differences in aging. By integrating across disciplines, approaches, and levels of biological organization, IISAGE will develop predictive models for how genome architecture, organismal biology, and phenotypic plasticity can interact and lead to sex-specific aging. IISAGE’s approach will include data from both wild species, laboratory manipulations, and citizen scientists to provide unprecedented insights into the mechanisms controlling sex differences in aging.</p>
<h2 id="broader-impacts">Broader Impacts</h2>
<p>IISAGE will produce novel analysis tools and hundreds of matched datasets profiling expression and chromatin in dozens of species, providing new resources for the scientific community. In addition, the insights into sex differences in aging derived from IISAGE’s work will be of interest to scientists ranging from basic biologists to translational researchers and individuals in the medical and conservation fields. Integrated with its interdisciplinary scientific mission, IISAGE’s training, education, and outreach program will increase diversity in STEM and prepare trainees to work in diverse careers and in multidisciplinary teams. The IISAGE REU program will engage 50 students from groups underrepresented in STEM. Our citizen science project will engage pet hobbyists and K-12 students in afterschool programs to collect demographic data to support IISAGE scientific goals. IISAGE will integrate outreach and research activities, while publicizing the importance of basic science.</p>
