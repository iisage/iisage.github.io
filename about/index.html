<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In many mammals, females tend to live longer than males.  In addition, sex differences in lifespan and aging are well documented in non-mammalian species, in both wild and captive populations, and in model systems maintained under controlled laboratory conditions.  However, sex differences in lifespan vary considerably across animal taxa, with some species exhibiting similar lifespans between the sexes and others showing increased lifespan in one sex.  How sex differences in aging and longevity arise and how they are linked to molecular drivers of aging such as genome instability is currently unknown.</p>
<p>Genome instability increases with age in many species and is considered an important contributor to aging.  Loss of genome integrity due to failure of heterochromatin and telomere maintenance leads to the activation of transposable elements and defects in chromosome segregation during cell division.  Data from model species suggest that manipulations that improve genome stability also increase lifespan.  However, there is a significant gap in knowledge because it is unclear whether and how genome instability impacts sex differences in aging and lifespan in species with diverse life histories and methods of sex determination.</p>
<p>Using the Biology Integration Institutes (BII) “Design” funding mechanism, the BII Integration Institute: Sex, Ageing, Genomics, and Epigenetics (IISAGE) will bring together experts in chromatin biology, organismal biology, aging biology, and evolutionary biology to address the question of how genome instability impacts sex differences in lifespan among taxa across the animal kingdom.  Specifically, the goals of the activities for IISAGE in the BII-Design phase are to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Refine the specific research questions to be addressed by IISAGE;</li>
<li>Develop an interdisciplinary training/career development program for the students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty involved in IISAGE; and</li>
<li>Establish the procedures necessary to facilitate data management and information exchange between the members of IISAGE.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sex differences in aging are pervasive throughout the animal kingdom, but the link between these sex differences and the molecular causes of aging such as genome instability are yet to be explored.  IISAGE will build a community of researchers from diverse biological disciplines to address this important question and design a coordinated set of studies to reveal the rules of life governing sex differences in aging.</p>
<h2 id="broader-impacts">Broader Impacts</h2>
<p>Utilizing the BII-Design funding mechanism, IISAGE will bring together an interdisciplinary community of researchers to broadly explore the question of how genome instability impacts sex differences in aging across the animal kingdom.  This community will be engaged in a series of workshops, both virtual and in person, and to date, 24 researchers, including seven international scholars, have committed to participating in the first workshop.  IISAGE will continue to engage the community by making workshop outcomes and resources available online, by publicizing the institute’s efforts at a variety of scientific conference, and by broadening participation in IISAGE by continued, targeted recruitment of additional researchers with diverse but relevant expertise.</p>
